And a few months later, my biggest jump landed. That was the 1st of September of 2016,
when reality kicks in and you start feeling overwhelmed and dizzy. Why? Because after 
3 years of being a Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow, I turned an *alumni* and my dream, 
got the inertia to move forward and being tested, for real. I was again out of my
comfort zone. 

But let's start from the beginning, and most importantly how did I get here?

## The beginning 

In 2010 I finished my PhD and I moved to Madrid with my future wife. I started to look
for a job, and I found it, but not in Spain, in Geneva and I could work from home.

I started to work for the Citizen Cyberscience Center (now the Citizen Cybersience Lab). That was
my first step to work professionally as an engineer in the citizen science field.

The next year I traveled to Cape Town, South Africa, to participate in a citizen science workshop,
organized by the Citizen Cyberscience Center. I was really excited to be in this workshop as Rufus
Pollock, the founder of Open Knowledge Foundation and Francois Grey the coordinator of the Center were
there too, and we could hack, code and develop new citizen science projects. One of them was PYBOSSA, 
and *I didn't know that my life was about to change forever.*


## Year 1: 2013-2014

Since the creation of PYBOSSA I devoted all my time to develop it. With different funding, PYBOSSA grew,
however, after 3 years there was no money left. 

In 2013 Francois Grey was looking for possible funders while I kept developing the technology. After some 
thinking he suggested me: why don't you apply to the Shuttleworth Foundation? Ha! Good question!

For those who don't know the Shuttleworth Foundation, it's one of its kind.  It is a foundation 
that fund people who are unafraid to re-imagine the world and the way we live in it.

With that tag line I was afraid of not being good enough to pass, plus if I got the funding, I was 
going to become my own boss. I would run the project, and I would be fully responsible for it. Also, I only
had one week left to apply. The application as many others include a form, but the most challenging part, a
video where you pitch your project. Only one week, lots to do, just call it stress.

I still remember how many times I had to edit my video application because the
video editor was crashing in my Ubuntu machine. After all the hard work, the foundation came back
to me, and said, Daniel, you have been accepted and are welcome to become a fellow. 

AMAZING

This was the beginning. Until that moment I've been working for someone, but since I got accepted
I WAS IN CHARGE of my own path, and that was SCARY, to say the least. However, the foundation make
you at home soon, so you can start addressing your future challenges without problems, and more importantly
they allow you to fail, so you can learn and share it, so others can learn and avoid the same mistakes.

2013 was the year when I started to build my own team. Did I say scary? Now I was in charge of
hiring people, finding talent, so PYBOSSA could be improved and moved to the next level.

I knew I needed three new roles in the team: a UX/UI person to help me to address all the usability
and design problems that we had, a developer to help me with the code and a devops to run the server and
also code.

But, where do I find them? After 3 years living in Madrid, I didn't know too many people. 
By accident, my wife has a friend, and her husband is one of the best UX/UI designers from Spain. That's how
I met Jorge Correa.

We started talking and discussing about the project, and if he could be interested. He said, yes,
and this is when the project really starts, as he has lots of contacts.

Jorge is now the person who introduces me to other people, and that's how I find a new developer from Spain (Alejandro).

Then, a devops is a recommended to me by another fellow of the foundation (Marvin), making a team of four. While we are working
I realized that while I have covered the technical aspects of my project, I was missing something very important: communication.

Again, through Jorge's contacts I found the fifth component of the crew (Clara). 

The crew was ready to rock!

During this first year, I was obsessed with knowing the real costs of running and developing PYBOSSA. 

I wanted to design a technology that could be flexible, scalable and used worldwide, showing that PYBOSSA 
is the best solution you can find for doing citizen science or crowdsourcing research.

The proof that we were moving in the right direction was: [Cities at night](https://scifabric.com/success-stories/citiesatnight/). 

Cities at Night is a research project that aims to monitor light emitted by major cities 
around the world and to raise awareness of light pollution. 

We developed a customised crowdsourced project for Cities at Night on Crowdcrafting.

Cities at Night asks volunteers to georeference photographs of cities taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

NASA holds over 1.2 million high resolution, colour photographs taken from the ISS. Researchers aim to assign real-world coordinates to images of cities at night in order to assess levels of light pollution.

The project went viral when NASA wrote a blog post about it, getting international coverage from media like: [CNN, NBC News, Fox News, Scientific America...](https://scifabric.com/press/). Out of the blue, NASA made our project visible to the world and thanks to thousands of volunteers from all over the world, more than one hundred thousand images were classified in less than a month, storing more than 1.5 contributions per second. 

In July of 2014, my first son Ã“liver was born. Changing my personal life forever. A new dimension in front of
me. 


## Year 2: 2014-2015

The shuttleworth foundation offer support up to 3 years, but you have to earn it. You've to pitch your
project every year to renew and get their support. Thus, a new video was born. This time I wanted to make
personal, as the foundation say, the invest in people, not in the technology or solution that you build.

VIDEO

The video shows who am I, what do I do every morning, and how I see the future of PYBOSSA. With one year of
experience and learning about managing a team, I discovered that I needed more help in explaining what PYBOSSA
is, and how people can participate.

And it looks like I convinced the foundation again, as they renewed me. If getting it the first year was amazing,
having a second one was even more incredible. To me it was a validation of my work, the people I've hired, and
what I was trying to achieve.

With a new injection of money for the project, I used the resources to grow the team. And I used the same techniques
as before: my network.

Using my network of people, specially Jorge's connections, I started to look for someone that could help me to
explain what PYBOSSA is. And I found it, Clara joined the team and she has been key to explain what we do.

I hired her because I wanted to have someone in my team that didn't know anything about science and what we do.
She was/is perfect. Knowing nothing about a topic allows you to ask the right questions, the stupid questions, as
those are the difficult ones that no one wants to ask.
