# Let's work together
My name is Daniel Lombraña González, and I am a fullstack developer and consultant with experience on crowsourcing projects, frontend and backend development using modern technologies.

I design open systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, security, and cost. Since 2011, I have been hired by international institutions like CERN, British Museum, British Library, Cancer Research UK, United Nations, Greenpeace Spain, etc.

I'm a senior developer with more than 10 years working with modern technologies like Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Vue.js, Nuxt, Sass, Stylus, etc.

My work has helped on assisting in the aftermath of humanitarian disasters (like Typhoon Pablo in the Philippines) by geolocalizing social network datasets in real time. I have supported studying cancer using your web browser, analyzed oil contracts between governments and major companies, or recovered a massive set of archaeological findings of the Bronze Age.

I'm available for hiring for your project. If you are interested, please, [book an online meeting with me](https://calendly.com/scifabric/) so we can meet online and discuss about your project.
