I love photography. In my free time, I take pictures of almost everything, nature, people, places, etc.</p>

As an amateur one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/2945647308/in/set-72157618769763161">biggests successes</a> has been to win a place in the first <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> OS contest for desktop wallpapers. The photo was included in the default CD-ROM and distributed as part of the wallpaper package, sharing my work with hundreds of people.</p>

More recently, the Spanish company <a href="https://twitter.com/AguaLanjaron/status/336382074833469440">Lanjar√≥n used another photo</a> from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teleyinex/4639737486/">portfolio</a> to promote their water.</p>
